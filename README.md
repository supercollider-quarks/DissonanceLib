# DissonanceLib

A library of psychoacoustic dissonance curves together with harmonic analysis functions for SuperCollider. Psychoacoustic and harmonic math to numbers and collections.

DissonanceLib depends on quarks: MathLib, VectorSpace and ZArchive. Optionally, the GNUPlot quark (and GNUPlot itself!) need to be installed in order to plot harmonic spaces and fields in PitchSet

Version 0.6

This library was part of the PhD thesis of Juan S. Lach, *Harmonic Duality. From interval ratios and pitch distance to spectra and sensory dissonance*.
